        <pre>
{
  "color": {

    "g": 190,
    "b": 191

          <p>this is for the Pouches and Bundles mod. This is an example of all possible keys able to be used in a pouch json file.
            the directory for pouches is <code>data/&#x3c;namespace&gt;/pouches/yourpouch.json</code>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: -1 just means its infinite

          </p>
          <p>
            maxDifferentItems: this is the maximum amount of different Items. for example of maxItems is -1 but maxDifferentItems is 2 you can have 500 diamons and 300 gold,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;however, you canNOT have 20 emeralds, 20 diamonds, and 20 gold since there is more than 2 types of items, only 2 of those three items will be able to be in.
          </p>
          <p>
            differentiateByNBT: if stuff like an enchantedsword and a regular sword should count as different items.
